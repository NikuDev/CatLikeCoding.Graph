Unity tutorial visualizing a graph using Unity objects - https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/building-a-graph/

## Includes
- Instantiating prefabs from a script
- Using a custom shader
- Shader changes it's colour based on the worldPosition
- Animating the prefabs

## Summary
A various amount of prefabs (cubes) can be used as points of a graph.
Over time these prefabs (cubes) change position due to a mathematical formula, whilst 
the custom shader will make each cube change colour based on the current position.
